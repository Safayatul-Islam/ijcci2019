    <p>Welcome to the International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence (IJCCI 2019) organized by University
      of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), Jahangirnagar University (JU), Bangladesh and South Asian University (SAU),
      India. This conference will be held on October 25-26, 2019 at University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB).</p>
    <p>This conference (named as IWCI 2016) for the first time successfully held on 12-13 December 2016 at Jahangirnagar
      University (JU), Bangladesh in collaboration with South Asian University (SAU), India under the technical
      co-sponsorship of IEEE Bangladesh Section. For details please visit IWCI 2016.</p>
    <p>IJCCI 2019 invites submissions of substantial, original, and previously unpublished research works on neural
      networks, evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy systems, machine learning and optimization. The Conference is focused to
      discuss the state-of-the-art developments, research challenges and unsolved open problems in the field of
      Computational Intelligence to beginners as well as to professionals. It will also provide a platform for students,
      scientists and faculty members to involve, interact, present and get reflections on their research. The official
      language of the Conference is English.
    </p>
    <h3>Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, previously unpublished work, not currently under
      review by another conference, workshop, or a journal.</h3>

    <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
